                description: "For a different take on a tougher cut of beef, we applied a tried-and-true technique for cooking steaks: reverse searing. We first cooked the ribs until they were medium-rare—about an hour in a 275-degree oven. Next, we quickly browned them over high heat on the stovetop to create a flavorful crust. Salting the short ribs and letting them sit for at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours before cooking seasoned them all the way through and aided in tenderizing the meat and retaining juices. The slow cook also helped break down the muscle fibers to ensure tenderness. For a luxurious sauce, we dressed up browned butter with shallot, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and Dijon mustard.",

We test everything for durability, washing items repeatedly and even tossing them off the counter. We make a smoothie in our winning blender 365 times in a row or dip a piping hot skillet into a bucket of ice water to check for warping. We call on experts—scientists, professors, industry specialists, and our own science research editor—to help us understand our test results.
